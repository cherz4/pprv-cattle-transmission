If you use the code or data provided here, please make sure to cite the above manuscript.

# Directories
- `data`: all clinical, molecular, tissue culture, and serological data
- `scripts`: all code

# How to reproduce the analyses
A guide to reproducing the analysis from the paper follows.

## Getting the code
First download the code. The recommended way is to git clone our Github repository from the command line:

`git clone https://github.com/cherz4/pprv-cattle-transmission.git`

 or by downloading it manually via Github's download button (see green Code button on main page of repository for options).

## Running the code
All code provided are as R scripts. At the top of each script the packages (libraries) needed will be indicated and you will want to install these ahead of time with
`install.packages(package_name)`

All scripts should run as long as the relative paths are not disrupted. Scripts corresponding to clinical, molecular, and serological data analysis and plotting for all five experimental trials are present, as well as calculation of the transmission probabilities and credible intervals that were used in the comparatmental modeling next-generation matrix framework for calculating R0. Pay careful attention to commenting in the code, some blocks may need to be commented in/out (with #) and run again to reproduce all analyses or figures.


# Data Dictionary

## Clinical Data
Scoring was based on the scoring system used in the following publication:
Pope, R. A. et al. Early events following experimental infection with Peste-Des-Petits ruminants virus suggest immune cell targeting. PLoS One 8, e55830 (2013).
In general, a higher score indicates a more noticeable clinical sign.

Column name and definition
- eartag: unique animal ID on eartag
- date: date sample was taken
- dpi: day post innoculation
- barn: which part this animal was located in during the experiment, among 6 barns
- innoc: binary variable, 1 if animal was innoculated, 0 if not innoculated
- barni: combination of barn number and innoculation status (a = inoculated, b = not inoculated)
- general: general behavior score based on Pope et al 2013
- temp: temperature score based on Pope et al 2013
